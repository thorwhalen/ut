    """Calculate mean update and a Youngs and Cramer variance update with weighted data.

    This is a based on the sklearn function.


    last_mean and last_variance are statistics computed at the last step by the
    function. Both must be initialized to 0.0.
    In case no scaling is required
    last_variance can be None. The mean is always required and returned because
    necessary for the calculation of the variance. last_n_samples_seen is the
    number of samples encountered until now.

    From the paper "Algorithms for computing the sample variance: analysis and
    recommendations", by Chan, Golub, and LeVeque.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : 2-tuple (X, w) where X is array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features) and weight is a (n_samples,) array
    indicating the weight of each row of X
        Data to use for variance update


    last_mean : array-like, shape: (n_features,)

    last_variance : array-like, shape: (n_features,)

    last_sample_count : int

    Returns
    -------
    updated_mean : array, shape (n_features,)

    updated_variance : array, shape (n_features,)
        If None, only mean is computed

    updated_sample_count : int
