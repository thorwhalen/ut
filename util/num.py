def spread(start, end, count, mode=1):
    """spread(start, end, count [, mode]) -> generator

    Yield a sequence of evenly-spaced numbers between start and end.

    The range start...end is divided into count evenly-spaced (or as close to
    evenly-spaced as possible) intervals. The end-points of each interval are
    then yielded, optionally including or excluding start and end themselves.
    By default, start is included and end is excluded.

    For example, with start=0, end=2.1 and count=3, the range is divided into
    three intervals:

        (0.0)-----(0.7)-----(1.4)-----(2.1)

    resulting in:

        >>> list(spread(0.0, 2.1, 3))
        [0.0, 0.7, 1.4]

    Optional argument mode controls whether spread() includes the start and
    end values. mode must be an int. Bit zero of mode controls whether start
    is included (on) or excluded (off); bit one does the same for end. Hence:

        0 -> open interval (start and end both excluded)
        1 -> half-open (start included, end excluded)
        2 -> half open (start excluded, end included)
        3 -> closed (start and end both included)

    By default, mode=1 and only start is included in the output.

    (Note: depending on mode, the number of values returned can be count,
    count-1 or count+1.)
